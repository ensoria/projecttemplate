// NewCreateSession trades a verified token for a browser session.
//
// The endpoint accepts only the token scheme. Accepting a session cookie here
// as well would let a session renew itself indefinitely without the identity
// provider ever being consulted again, which is exactly the property the
// absolute deadline exists to deny. An API key is refused for a plainer reason:
// it belongs to a service, and a service has no browser to put a cookie in.
//
// It requires no scope. The caller is asking to keep being who the token
// already says they are, and a scope check here would be asking permission for
// a permission they hold.

			"every later request authenticates with the cookie the browser stores from this response, " +
			"and needs no token at all.\n\n" +
			"The session's lifetime is independent of the token's: the token only has to be valid at " +
			"this moment. That is the point of the exchange — a short-lived token can keep a browser " +
			"signed in for as long as the session lasts.\n\n" +
			"⚠ Because the credential is a cookie, the browser attaches it to requests this " +
			"application did not initiate. Requests that change state are therefore refused unless " +
			"the browser reports an origin the deployment trusts (CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN); a caller that " +
