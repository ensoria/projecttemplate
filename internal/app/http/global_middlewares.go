// This file declares the global middleware chain: what runs on every HTTP
// request, in order. It is separate from http.go so that adding a middleware is
// an edit to a declaration rather than to the server plumbing — everything a
// project changes to put something new in front of every request is the one
// list below, and nothing here builds a server.
//
// (Detached from the package clause on purpose: this describes the file, and a
// comment touching `package http` would become the package's documentation.)

// globalMiddlewareChain is the single statement of what runs on every request,
// in order. The pipeline and the generated documentation are both projections
// of it — globalMiddlewares takes the Build side, GlobalMiddlewareNames the Name
// side — so a middleware added here reaches both, and one cannot describe a
// pipeline the other does not run.
//
// It was two lists until 2026-09-07, and they had already drifted: the names
// stayed at four entries after CSRF and Auth joined the chain, so every
// generated document described a pipeline the application had stopped running
// two phases earlier. Nothing could have caught it, because nothing in the type
// system relates a []rest.Middleware to a []string.
//
// # Order
//
// The chain runs outside-in, so authentication sits last: logging, panic
// recovery and CORS still apply to a request that is refused, and a CORS
// preflight (which carries no credential) is answered before authentication is
// considered.
//
// The cross-origin check sits between CORS and authentication. Before
// authentication, so a forged request is refused without the session store being
// asked about the cookie it carried; after CORS, so a preflight is still
// answered by the one middleware that knows how to answer it.
//
// ⚠ Only one of those two refuses anything. CORS tells the browser what it may
// read and refuses nothing; the cross-origin check refuses state-changing
// requests from origins this deployment does not claim. See middleware.CORS for
// why the split is that way round.
